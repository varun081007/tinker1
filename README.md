User Profile Input – The user provides their education, skills, location, and career preferences.

Opportunities Data – A Google Sheet contains available jobs, internships, or skill programs.

Automation Engine (n8n) – The workflow runs daily (or manually) and performs the following:

Aggregates user profile and opportunities

Sends the combined data to an AI (ChatGPT) for matching

Classifies opportunities as STRONG_MATCH or NO_STRONG_MATCH

Conditional Logic (IF Node) – Checks whether there are strong matches.

Email Notification – Sends a digest email to the user:

Lists top 3 matching opportunities with one-line reasoning

If none match, sends a message: “No strong matches today.”
